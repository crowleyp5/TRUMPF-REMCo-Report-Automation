# TRUMPF-REMCo-Report-Automation
This is an example of a report that I automated at as a Business Management Intern at TRUMPF North America. Robert E. Morris Co. (REMCo) was a major customer who requested that we give them a report every two weeks that showed details on all laser orders currently being processed or shipped. They suggested an excel spreadhseet and asked that we highlight new orders in blue, completed orders in grey, subsequent deliveries in beige, and updated fields in yellow. This code compares the old and newest versions of REMCo orders. The comparison was simple, so most of the code focuses on its presentation in terms of highlighting, sorting, borders, column widths, etc. It also adds hyperlinks for tracking information. Without disclosing customer information, this is what the spreadheet looks like when complete. ![image](https://github.com/crowleyp5/TRUMPF-REMCo-Report-Automation/assets/108026566/8cead1d6-bfd3-41a2-8fb4-8b76d2d8758f)
